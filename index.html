Petney would pick up a small child as soon as he saw it, and that Petney would take the form of any human being. So no one could catch that petni. Talking about this, Ramesh and Jadu were returning home after finishing work from the field. Ramesh said I have only one son so I am very scared because one day my son will not be picked up by that petni. Jadu said yes brother I am really worried too.

He looked to see if there was water anywhere around. But he did not find water anywhere. Suddenly a pitcher fell in his eyes. He immediately went downstairs hoping to get some water and sat down on the pitcher. But the water fell just below the pitcher. Seeing this, the crow became sad.
