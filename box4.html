        <h1>The story of the crow and the pitcher  </h1>
        <p> September 24,2020</p>
        <div id="box-4">
            
            <p>It was very hot that summer. One such afternoon a crow was flying from afar. As a result of flying for a long time, he got very thirsty for water. He looked to see if there was water anywhere around. But he did not find water anywhere. Suddenly a pitcher fell in his eyes. He immediately went downstairs hoping to get some water and sat down on the pitcher. But the water fell just below the pitcher. Seeing this, the crow became sad. But since he could not find water anywhere else in the vicinity, he began to think about how to get water out of that pitcher 
                <img src="photo3.jpg" alt="">
              <p>  At first he thought he would push the jug, then the water would come to the mouth of the jug and he would be able to eat. The fact is that the jug was very heavy. So the crow could not push the pitcher in any way. However, the crow could not move the pitcher even 
                after trying hard.</p>
<p>                
So he thought once more, if he could pierce the pitcher with his lips, he would be able to drink that water effortlessly. He tried but it was so hard that after many attempts he could not break the pitcher but he hit his lip while trying to do so.</p>
<p>
Then the crow almost gave up hope of drinking water, at which point he decided to make one last attempt. He decided that if he failed again, he would fly away and look for water elsewhere. So this time he used his intellect in a slightly different way. He decided that if a lot of small stones could be thrown into the water, the water would rise to the surface and he would be able to quench his thirst by drinking that water. So he started looking for small stones. He collected many small stones from all around and started throwing them inside the jug. After a while it was seen that the water in the jug had really come up. Then the crow drank the cold water inside the jug and set off for its destination.</p>

Advice: No matter how bad the time, it should not be without hull.</p>

The lion was very angry, the lion said to the little rat, you know who I am? You have so much courage to get into my nose. I can kill you right now. Hearing this, Nenti got very scared and apologized to him.... <a id="ankor"href="box5.html">READ MORE</a></p>
